# Assignment 02: String Class

## Due June 4

To complete our section on C++, functions, iterative / recursive problem solving, and algorithm analysis, we will be building and analyzing a fully-functional string class.

## What you have to do

Your first task is to implement all of the functions described in the `string.hpp` file such that you pass all unit tests.

> Note that at least 5 of your methods **must** be implemented using recursion.

Then, you must analyze all of your functions and provide their Big-Oh, Omega, and Theta notations.

You are allowed to use any and all class materials, and you may discuss your algorithms with other students, however, you may not look at another students' code.

## Submission

Submission for this assignment will be handled by Github Classrooms.
A link to the assignment will be posted in the Slack channel for this assignment.

Here is an additional copy of the link [to the assignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/KmYo-coT)

## Grading

This assignment is worth 100 points, with 50 points for functionality, 40 for analysis, and 10 for readability.

> If your analysis is correct given your algorithm, but your implementation fails the unit tests, you will still receive full credit for your analysis.
